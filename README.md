Problem
In a country , all the ants move in a circle. There is a circle marked with  marks with numbers from  to  clockwise. There are  ants on the circle. No two ants stand on the same mark initially. It is also known in which direction each ant will move. If two ants meet during the movement, then each of them begins to move in a different direction. Your task is to determine where the ants will be after  seconds of such movement.

Input format

The first line contains the numbers  .
The following  lines have the following format:
Each line contains two numbers  and . The first number of this line  is the position of the ant, the second number of this line  is the direction in which the ant moves. Here, , if the ant starts to move clockwise and  if counterclockwise. The distances between adjacent marks are the same. In one second, the ant overcomes a distance equal to the distance between adjacent marks on the circle.
Output format

In the first line, print  integers in ascending order denoting the positions where the ants will be in  seconds after such obsessive moves.
